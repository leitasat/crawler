To install and build the project please run: `npm install && npm run build`

To run it for 'google.com': `npm start http://google.com`

To run tests: `npm test`

Note: the crawler does not support domains in other alphabets than latin. 
Note 2: I was not able to wait until it finishes with some websites, so I have decided to make it save intermidiate results to the file ('results.json')
